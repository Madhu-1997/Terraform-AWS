# Terraform:

Terraform is an open-source infrastructure as code (IaC) tool created by HashiCorp. It allows users to define and provision infrastructure in a declarative configuration language. With Terraform, you can describe your infrastructure, such as servers, databases, networking components, and other resources, in a configuration file, and then use Terraform to create and manage those resources across various cloud providers or on-premises environments.

## How does Terraform work?
Terraform creates and manages resources on cloud platforms and other services through their application programming interfaces (APIs). Providers enable Terraform to work with virtually any platform or service with an accessible API.
